# CODE CHALLENGES MAJORITY VOTE ALGORITHM

## Features
- majority means element appears more than half the time > (n / 2)

```
Problem: Given an array of boolean values (0s and 1s), determine if there is a majority element (an element that appears more than half the time). If such an element exists, return it; otherwise, return a special value indicating no majority.

Algorithm:

Initialize a variable count to 0.
Iterate through the array:
For each boolean value, increment count if the value is 1, and decrement it if the value is 0.
If count is greater than 0 at the end of the iteration, return 1 (assuming this is the majority element).
If count is less than or equal to 0, return -1 (or a special value indicating no majority).
Why it works:

The key insight is that if there is a majority element, its sum will be greater than half the length of the array. When iterating through the array, we effectively keep a running total of the "votes" for each element.

If an element has more than half the votes (i.e., appears more than half the time), count will eventually exceed 0. If there is no majority element, count will oscillate around 0 and never exceed it.

Properties:

The algorithm has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
It has a constant space complexity of O(1), since we only use a single variable to keep track of the count.
The algorithm is deterministic, meaning that given the same input, it will always produce the same output.
The Majority Vote Algorithm is a classic example of a simple yet effective algorithm in computer science.
