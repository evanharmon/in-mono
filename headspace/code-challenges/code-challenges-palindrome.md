# CODE CHALLENGES PALINDROME

## Features

- word is the same when spelled backwards

## Limitations

- a one character string is still a palindrome

## Strategies

### Simple reverse string

- reverse string
- iterate and compare each string

### Iterator without reverse

- iterate through string and check opposing char at end

improvements:

- track midpoint and exit early
