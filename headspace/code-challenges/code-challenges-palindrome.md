# CODE CHALLENGES PALINDROME

## Features

- word is the same when spelled backwards

## Limitations

- a one character string is still a palindrome

## Simple reverse string strategy

- reverse string
- iterate and compare each string

## Iterator without reverse strategy

- iterate through string and check opposing char at end

improvements:

- track midpoint and exit early
