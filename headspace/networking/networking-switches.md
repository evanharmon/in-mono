# NETWORKING SWITCHES

## Features

- operates on OSI layer2: data link layer
- forwards based on MAC address
- operates in full-duplex mode and avoids collisions

## Limitations

- enables traffic only within a single network

## MAC addresses
- maintains a MAC address table to map physical ports to devices
- incoming frames are examined for destination MAC address, then forwarded or dropped
