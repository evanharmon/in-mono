# AWS EXAM TIPS IAM

## IAM

- PowerUserAccess = AdministrativeAcess - IAM
- least privilege means NO admin access policy

## Cross Account Roles

- remember that the CROSS account creates the role and trusts the other account
- NO aws account can create a role in its own IAM to control another AWS account
- answers should not just mention the role but say something about ASSUMING role
