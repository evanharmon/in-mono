## User Pools

#### Multiple Account / Identities

- [Link Existing User Account With Identity From External Provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminLinkProviderForUser.html)

#### User Pool Setup

- create sms role if you want sms
- if using email, create SES verified identity. Log in to email to verify

## Identity Pools

Each unauthenticated user has a unique identity in the identity pool, even though they haven't been individually logged in and authenticated

## Server Side Token Check

Cognito Identity Pools DO NOT check against the user pool by default. This
means a user can be disabled / deleted in the User Pool and their identity pool
authorization creds will STILL WORK

#### Turn On Server Side Token Check

```console
aws cognito-identity update-identity-pool \
  --identity-pool-id \
  --identity-pool-name \
  --allow-unauthenticated-identities \
  --cognito-identity-providers ProviderName=,ClientId=,ServerSideTokenCheck=<true|false>
```

#### Mobile Setup NOTE!!

If your app uses Google and will be available on multiple mobile platforms,
you should configure it as an OpenID Connect Provider, adding all created
client IDs as additional audience values to allow for better integration. To
learn more about Google's cross-client identity model, see Cross-client
Identity.
### Scopes

The phone, email, and profile scopes can only be requested if openid is also requested.

### Implicit Grant

Only use the implicit grant when there’s a specific reason that the
authorization code grant can’t be used. This exposes the user pool tokens.

However, if your setup doesn’t contain any server-side logic, you may want to
use the implicit grant to prevent refresh tokens from being exposed to the
client, as the implicit grant does not generate refresh tokens.

#### Authorization Code Grant

Benefit is that user pool token is never shared with end user.

#### Implicit Grant

- Does not generate refresh tokens.
- This is the preferred method for security on
  Single-Page Applications (SPA) which reveal the Client Secret.

### Google

#### Typical Identity Provider Details

terraform property example

```hcl
provider_details = {
  attributes_url                = "https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/me?personFields="
  attributes_url_add_attributes = "true"
  authorize_url                 = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"
  authorize_scopes              = "profile email openid"
  client_id                     = "myid"
  client_secret                 = "mysecret"
  oidc_issuer                   = "https://accounts.google.com"
  token_request_method          = "POST"
  token_url                     = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"
}

attribute_mapping = {
  email    = "email"
  username = "sub"
}
```

### Facebook

#### Common Errors

##### URL blocked Redirect URI is not whitelisted

Don't forget to also change the Valid Oauth Redirect URL in
`Products, Facebook Login, Settings`. The url should end in `/idpresponse`

#### Typical Identity Provider Details

terraform property example

```hcl
provider_details = {
  api_version                   = "v6.0"
  attributes_url                = "https://graph.facebook.com/v6.0/me?fields="
  attributes_url_add_attributes = "true"
  authorize_url                 = "https://www.facebook.com/v6.0/dialog/oauth"
  authorize_scopes              = "public_profile,email"
  client_id                     = "myid"
  client_secret                 = "mysecret"
  oidc_issuer                   = "https://accounts.google.com"
  token_request_method          = "GET"
  token_url                     = "https://graph.facebook.com/v6.0/oauth/access_token"
}

attribute_mapping = {
  email    = "email"
  username = "id"
}
```

### Apple ID

#### Typical Identity Provider Details

terraform property example

```hcl
provider_details = {
  attributes_url_add_attributes = "false"
  authorize_scopes              = "email, name"
  authorize_url                 = "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize"
  client_id                     = "com.mycompany.myapp"
  key_id                        = "mysecret"
  oidc_issuer                   = "https://appleid.apple.com"
  private_key                    = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- XXXX -----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
  team_id                       = "AAAAAAAAAA"
  token_request_method          = "POST"
  token_url                     = "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token"
}

attribute_mapping = {
  email    = "email"
  username = "sub"
}
```
