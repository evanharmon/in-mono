# Terraform Cloud Folder Structure Best Practices

Here are some recommended best practices for organizing your Terraform Cloud folder structure in a Git repository:

## Root-Level Organization

```
repository/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
├── modules/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── backend.tf
```

## Key Recommendations

1. **Use environment-based directories**
   - Create separate directories for each environment (dev, staging, prod)
   - This enables environment-specific configurations while maintaining consistency

2. **Create reusable modules**
   - Keep shared infrastructure components in a centralized `modules` directory
   - Follow a standardized interface pattern for your modules

3. **Implement consistent naming conventions**
   - Use prefixes to identify resource types
   - Establish consistent naming for files (e.g., `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`)

4. **Structure each environment directory**
   ```
   environments/dev/
   ├── main.tf            # Main configuration
   ├── variables.tf       # Input variables
   ├── outputs.tf         # Output values
   ├── terraform.tfvars   # Environment-specific values
   └── backend.tf         # Backend configuration
   ```

5. **Separate state files by environment**
   - Configure unique backend state paths for each environment
   - Example: `workspaces { name = "my-app-${var.environment}" }`

6. **Implement standardized module structure**
   ```
   modules/vpc/
   ├── main.tf
   ├── variables.tf
   ├── outputs.tf
   └── README.md          # Document module usage
   ```

7. **Add repository-level documentation**
   - Include setup instructions in the root README.md
   - Document workflow for contributions and deployments

8. **Thoughtful .gitignore configuration**
   - Exclude `.terraform/` directories
   - Exclude `*.tfstate` and `*.tfstate.backup` files
   - Consider excluding `terraform.tfvars` if containing sensitive values

Having multiple AWS accounts adds another dimension to your Terraform structure. There are a few approaches you can take, and it depends on your specific organizational needs.

## Account-Based Structuring Options

### Option 1: Environment-based with account differentiation
```
repository/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── account1/
│   │   └── account2/
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── account1/
│   │   └── account2/
│   └── prod/
│       ├── account1/
│       └── account2/
├── modules/
└── ...
```

### Option 2: Account-based with environment differentiation
```
repository/
├── accounts/
│   ├── account1/
│   │   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── staging/
│   │   └── prod/
│   └── account2/
│       ├── dev/
│       ├── staging/
│       └── prod/
├── modules/
└── ...
```

## Recommendations for Multiple Accounts

Generally, Option 2 (account-based structure) is considered a better practice when you have multiple AWS accounts because:

1. **Alignment with AWS's account strategy**: AWS recommends using separate accounts for isolation boundaries, which maps cleanly to your folder structure

2. **Clearer permission boundaries**: Teams often have permissions to specific accounts, making it easier to manage repository permissions

3. **Simpler state management**: You can more easily manage Terraform state files per account

4. **Blast radius containment**: Changes to one account won't affect others

5. **Account-specific configurations**: Some resources may only exist in specific accounts (like organization-level resources)

If your accounts serve different purposes (e.g., networking account, shared services account, application accounts), this approach makes even more sense as each account will likely have different types of resources.

You can still use consistent modules across accounts to maintain standardization, while keeping the account-specific configurations separate.
