# Terraform Workspaces in a Multi-Account Structure

Terraform workspaces add another layer to your organization strategy. Here's how they can fit into your multi-account structure:

## Workspace Strategy Options

### 1. Environment-Based Workspaces
With this approach, you maintain separate workspaces for each environment within a single account configuration:

```
accounts/
├── account1/
│   └── main.tf (uses workspace for env selection)
└── account2/
    └── main.tf (uses workspace for env selection)
```

In this pattern:
- You'd have workspaces like `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`
- Your configuration uses workspace-based conditionals: `terraform.workspace == "dev"`
- You switch workspaces when deploying: `terraform workspace select dev`

### 2. Component-Based Workspaces
This approach uses workspaces to separate different components within an account/environment:

```
accounts/
├── account1/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── main.tf (references workspaces for components)
│   └── prod/
│       └── main.tf (references workspaces for components)
└── account2/
    └── ...
```

With component workspaces like `network`, `database`, `application`, etc.

### 3. Feature-Based Workspaces
For development teams working on feature branches:

```
accounts/
├── account1/
│   └── dev/
│       └── main.tf (uses workspaces for feature branches)
└── ...
```

## Recommended Approach

For multi-account AWS setups, the most common and recommended approach is:

**File structure for environment isolation + limited workspace usage**

```
accounts/
├── account1/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── main.tf (may use component-based workspaces)
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── account2/
    ├── dev/
    └── ...
```

In this pattern:
- Your primary isolation comes from the directory structure
- Workspaces are used sparingly and for specific purposes:
  - Component isolation within an environment
  - Temporary feature branches in development
  - Managing slight variations in otherwise identical infrastructure

## Best Practices for Workspace Usage

1. **Prefer directory structure over workspaces for major boundaries**
   - File structure provides better visibility and auditability than workspaces

2. **Use workspace-aware state backends**
   - In Terraform Cloud, use explicitly named workspaces
   - Example: `terraform { backend "remote" { organization = "my-org" workspaces { name = "account1-dev-network" } } }`

3. **Document workspace requirements**
   - Include clear instructions on which workspace to use in README files

4. **Consider workspace limitations**
   - Workspaces share state storage, backend config, and provider configuration

5. **Be mindful of workspace scope**
   - Prefer directory structure for long-lived environment differences
   - Use workspaces for temporary variations or logical groupings

This balanced approach gives you the clarity of directory-based organization with the flexibility of workspaces where needed.
