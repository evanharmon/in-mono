# PYTHON HASH SETS

## Features
uses hash functions

## Complexity
Lookup: O(1) average, O(n) worst case
Insertion: O(1) average, O(n) worst case
Deletion: O(1) average, O(n) worst case

Space: O(n)

Worst case is hit based on collisions, hash function quality, and load factor

## Limitations
- hash set won't throw an error on duplicate items - just won't add them
- do not maintain order - no guarantee
