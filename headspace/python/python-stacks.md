# PYTHON STACKS

## Features
use the `list` builtin data type
- good old 'LIFO' last-in-first-out

## Time complexity
O(1) for push, pop, peek

## Space complexity
O(n) - it's gotta hold the list elements

## Typical operations
- `append()` is python's push equivalanet
- `pop()` with no args to pop from stack

## Missing operations
- no `peek` function so just look at elem in list like `my_list[-1]`
