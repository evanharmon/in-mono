# PYTHON LINKED LISTS

## Use cases
- undo / redo
- text processing
- graph algorithms

## Comparison to arrays
linkedlists:
- only allocate memory as required
- more efficient insert / delete
- takes O(n) time to access elements

arrays:
- allocate large chunks of memory for array size
- insert / delete is expensive in comparison
- O(1) to access items

## Time complexity
O(1) for insert and delete
searching can be worst case O(n) as list has to be traversed
