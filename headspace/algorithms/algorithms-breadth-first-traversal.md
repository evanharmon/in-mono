# ALGORITHMS - BREADTH FIRST TRAVERSAL

## Resources
- [Geeks for geeks applications of BFS](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-breadth-first-traversal/)

## Features
visits all the nodes at a given level before moving on to the next level.
- starts at the root node, then moves deeper in tree
- uses queues

## Use Cases
when needing to start at the top of the tree

### Finding shortest path
- network routing
- social network analysis
- route planning

### Level order traversal
visit all nodes at each depth before moving on
- filesystem
- database

### Topological sort
determine the order in which nodes should be visited in a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
