My monorepo. It's a place to explore, break, and fix in the spirit of learning quickly

## Headspace

The `./headspace` folder contains tons of information from my experiences as a Lead Consultant and Cloud Engineer

## Challenges

I would much rather be doing POCs and learning new tech to help my fellow teammates.
I guess I have to do `./challenges` though as well. :-1:

## Running `./apps`

This monorepo is brought to you by turborepo. All commands are run from the root of the repo:

run all apps

```console
npm run dev
```

run a single app with package dependencies

```console
npx turbo run dev --filter=music...
```
